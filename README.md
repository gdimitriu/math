math examples using maple/mathematica/mathcad/matlab

Those are project done at different silabus/projects in university.

Some project has documentation in Romanian, very few has documentation or menu in English.

Most are written in matlab and maple.

Those are put in hope that someone need them, as example of how to use different tools and techniques.

I do not maintain them anymore.
